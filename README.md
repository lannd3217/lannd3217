## 📂 Featured Projects  
### [Inference and Prediction of PM2.5 Exposure on Youth’s Mobility Outcomes](https://github.com/lannd3217/Inference-and-Prediction-of-PM2.5-Exposure-on-Youth-s-Mobility-Outcomes) 

This project investigates the relationship between air quality (measured through PM2.5 levels) and socioeconomic mobility across California counties. By combining environmental and economic datasets, I aim to understand how exposure to poor air quality during childhood influences long-term economic outcomes. My analysis employs causal inference and predictive modeling techniques to assess and quantify these relationships.

### [Absenteeism Prediction Model](https://github.com/lannd3217/chronic-absenteeism)

This project analyzes and predicts chronic absebteeism among students in schools within the Oakland District. By leveraging historical attendance, demographics, and academic data, I build machine learning models to predict absenteeism risks and provide insights for early intervention.
